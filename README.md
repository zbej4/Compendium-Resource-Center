# Compendium-Resource-Center

#Version 0.2 - Fixes options issue and adds base of functions for population.
#Version 0.3 - This update finalizes the output of the plugin and adds the page title and icons options. There still exists a bug with the jquery-ui select menu, and no css styles have been applied to the front end.
